/**
 * GET /api/providers/zai-web-free/prerequisites
 *
 * Checks whether Playwright + Chromium are installed and whether the device
 * token pool has tokens. Used by the ZaiPrerequisiteBanner component to
 * show warnings before the user enables zai-web-free or adds a zai-web-token
 * connection.
 *
 * The Playwright/Chromium check is EXPENSIVE (it launches a headless browser,
 * ~3-5s). We cache the result for 60s to avoid re-launching on every page load
 * or React re-render. The pool size is always read fresh (cheap SQLite query).
 *
 * Returns:
 *   200: {
 *     playwrightInstalled: boolean,
 *     chromiumInstalled: boolean,
 *     poolSize: number,
 *     cached: boolean,           // true if Playwright result came from cache
 *     cacheAge: number,          // age of cache in ms (0 if fresh)
 *   }
